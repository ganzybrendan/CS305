# CS305

The client, Artemis Financial is a finance services company that handeles transactions and customer data. The issue that the company wanted me address was enhancing the security in their software to protect their system against brute force attacks, data breaches, and unauthorized access to their systems. It`s important to code securely because it prevents against these  types of cyber attacks. The most challenging aspect about this vulnerability assesment was converting the HTTP browser to HTTPS. However I increased the level of security of Artemis Financial by implementing SSL/TLS encryption, using the SHA-256 hash and ran security tests with OWASP dependency checks. The resources and tools that I used to complete this were the java keytool, OWASP dependancy check, and the checknsum verification.
